# Nova App State Report

_Generated: June 9, 2025_

## Executive Summary

Nova is currently a beautifully designed frontend prototype with zero backend
functionality. While the UI/UX is polished and complete, all data is mocked and
no user data persists between sessions. The authentication layer (Clerk) is the
only functional backend service.

**Project Completion: ~20%**

- Frontend UI: 90% complete
- Backend Services: 5% complete
- Core Features: 10% complete

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ What's Working

1. **Authentication**: Clerk integration is fully functional
2. **UI/UX**: All pages have polished, responsive designs
3. **Navigation**: Routing and page structure is complete
4. **Local State**: Forms and interactions work within sessions
5. **Design System**: Consistent theming with shadcn/ui components

### ❌ What's Stubbed/Missing

#### 1. **Data Persistence**

- No database integration (Supabase configured but not connected)
- All journal entries are mocked
- User preferences don't save
- No API routes implemented

#### 2. **Nova AI Assistant**

- Returns placeholder responses only
- No BAML integration
- No context awareness from journal entries
- No weekly insights generation

#### 3. **Core Journal Features**

- Journal entries don't save
- Calendar shows fake entry dates
- Progress tracking is hardcoded
- Streak counting is static

#### 4. **Analytics & Insights**

- All insights are placeholder text
- No actual data analysis
- No pattern recognition
- Weekly insights show "need more data" message

#### 5. **User Features**

- Export data shows "coming soon"
- Settings toggles don't persist
- Daily reminders not implemented
- Profile customization missing

## Recommended Implementation Path

### Week 1-2: Foundation

1. Set up Supabase with proper schema
2. Implement journal CRUD operations
3. Connect all existing UI to real data
4. Add user preference persistence

### Week 3-4: Nova MVP

5. Integrate BAML for basic chat
6. Add context awareness from journal entries
7. Implement simple weekly insights
8. Set up basic cron infrastructure

### Week 5-6: Polish & Enhancement

9. Add data export functionality
10. Implement real analytics
11. Enhance Nova's responses
12. Add mood tracking

### Week 7-8: Advanced Features

13. Build personality analysis system
14. Create personalized prompt system
15. Refine weekly insights algorithm
16. Performance optimization

## Technical Debt & Cleanup Needed

1. **Remove all mock data** from components
2. **Create proper TypeScript interfaces** for all data models
3. **Implement error handling** throughout the app
4. **Add loading states** for async operations
5. **Create reusable hooks** for data fetching
6. **Set up proper environment** for dev/staging/prod
7. **Add comprehensive testing** suite
8. **Implement proper logging** and monitoring

## Architecture Recommendations

### Database Schema (Supabase)

```sql
-- Core tables needed
- users (extends Clerk data)
- journal_entries
- journal_prompts
- user_responses
- ai_conversations
- weekly_insights
- user_preferences
```

### API Structure

```
/api/journal/
  - GET /entries
  - POST /entries
  - PUT /entries/:id
  - DELETE /entries/:id

/api/nova/
  - POST /chat
  - GET /insights/weekly
  - GET /context

/api/user/
  - GET /preferences
  - PUT /preferences
  - POST /export
```

### State Management

Consider adding a global state solution (Zustand/Jotai) for:

- User preferences
- Journal entries cache
- Nova conversation history
- UI state (modals, notifications)

## Success Metrics to Track

1. **User Engagement**

   - Daily active users
   - Average session length
   - Streak maintenance rate
   - Journal completion rate

2. **Feature Adoption**

   - Nova chat usage
   - Weekly insights views
   - Prompt response rate
   - Export feature usage

3. **Technical Health**
   - API response times
   - Error rates
   - Database query performance
   - AI response quality

## Conclusion

Nova has an excellent foundation with beautiful UI and clear vision. The primary
need is backend implementation to make the prototype functional. Following the
prioritized roadmap above will deliver a working MVP in 4 weeks and a
feature-complete app in 8 weeks.

The most critical next step is setting up Supabase and implementing basic CRUD
operations for journal entries. This will immediately unlock value for users and
provide the foundation for all other features.
